- Providing backend services for web or mobile applications.

### 5. Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)

**Description**: Amazon EKS is a fully managed Kubernetes service that simplifies the running of Kubernetes on AWS. It allows you to easily manage the orchestration and deployment of containerized applications.

**Features**:

- **Managed Control Plane**: AWS manages the Kubernetes control plane, including updates and scaling.
- **Seamless Integration with AWS**: Integrates with other AWS services such as IAM, ECR, and CloudWatch for observability and security.
- **Open Source Tools Compatibility**: Works with standard Kubernetes tools and applications, allowing you to use popular tooling.
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Automatically spreads applications across multiple Availability Zones for high availability.

**Use Cases**:

- Running production-grade Kubernetes workloads in a fully managed environment.
- Implementing microservices using Kubernetes orchestration.
- Migrating existing Kubernetes workloads to the cloud.

### 6. Amazon EKS Distro

**Description**: Amazon EKS Distro (EKS-D) is the same Kubernetes distribution used by Amazon EKS. It provides a consistent and reliable way to run Kubernetes applications both in cloud environments and on-premises.

**Features**:

- **Open Source**: Based on the same open source code that powers EKS.
- **Consistency**: Ensures a consistent Kubernetes experience across environments, whether on AWS or on-premises.
- **Security Updates and Patching**: Regular updates for security and performance improvements.
- **Integration with EKS**: Easily integrates into existing Amazon EKS workflows and setups.

**Use Cases**:

- Running Kubernetes workloads on-premises that mirror the cloud-based environment.
- Enabling hybrid cloud strategies with consistent Kubernetes operations.
- Testing and developing Kubernetes applications in a controlled environment.

### 7. AWS Fargate

**Description**: AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS. It allows users to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters.

**Features**:

- **Serverless Experience**: Automatically provisions and scales compute resources based on the requirements of the containerized application.
- **Pay-as-You-Go Pricing**: You only pay for the resources your containers consume.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS for flexible deployment choices.
